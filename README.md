**Disclaimer**: The game is in its 'proof of concept' stage. It's a simple endless runner with basic mechanics like jumping and picking up items.

**Instructions**: 

Use the spacebar or the up arrow to jump. 

Press 1, 2 to select a sign.

To activate a sign, press 'A'.

**Walkthrough**: Collect power-ups (lilac, gooseberries, oils, potions and other special items) to gain points. Avoid enemies by jumping over them, or jump on them to give them a taste of silver (boots).
