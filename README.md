**Disclaimer**: The game is in its 'proof of concept' stage. It's a simple endless runner with basic mechanics like jumping and picking up items.

**Instructions**: 

Use the spacebar or the up arrow to jump. 

Press 1, 2 or 3 to select a sign.

To activate a sign, press 'A'.

<i>Quen</i> creates a magic shield around you, absorbing physical damage and blocking enemy attacks.

<i>Igni</i> shoots a fireball, killing every enemy it encounters.

To pause/unpause the game, press 'P'.

To access the in-game menu, press 'I' (inventory, alchemy, character stats, shop).

**Walkthrough**: Collect power-ups (lilac, gooseberries, oils, potions and other special items) to gain points and be careful not to miss any Gwent cards! Avoid enemies by jumping over them, or jump on them to give them a taste of silver (boots).
